## Create With Akliz

Create with Akliz is a modpack that we designed for the Akliz public Minecraft server. It is a Create-centric pack with performance as the main focus. It includes an economy system plus several unique quality of life mods, some of which you may have never seen before!

We wanted as many people as possible to be able to run this modpack very smoothly so that our server won't exclude anyone. This pack is designed to be ready to play out of the box. Those settings you always have to change when you start a new modpack? We've already tweaked them for you. The Akliz public server is already added in the multiplayer menu.

Shaders are also enabled by default. We managed to get shaders running more smoothly than vanilla plus shaders on our machines so if you've never been able to run shaders before, you may be able to in this modpack! We've tweaked the shader settings to perfection as well. Of course, you always have the option to disable them if shaders aren't your jam.
